## About Me

Heyo, I'm Kaiden! (you might see my username as ka-iden, ka_iden, \_kden, or fl2mexd)  
My pronouns are He/Him, and I'm currently studying IT at RMIT.  
I enjoy coding primarily in C++ & C, and I've recently picked up ASM and am learning Vulkan.  
I have a website that lives at: [ka-iden.github.io](/) (that's here!)

Fun fact: I'm from Australia so i'm uʍop ǝpᴉsdn ʎlʇuǝɹɹnɔ

### Skills

- 🔭 I primarily code in C++ and C (and i can do a bit of ASM, inline and 16-bit!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vulkan & industry standard real-time rendering techniques!
- 😎 My latest project is a [C++ & Vulkan Renderer][hyper]
- 😢 In case you notice a gap in my contributions, I'm probably focusing on studying for uni!

### Interests

I have a keen interest in game development, graphics programming, and low-level systems programming.  
When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing games, spending time with friends, learning and trying new things.
