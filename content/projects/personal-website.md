## Overview

This is my personal website built using Hugo as a static site generator. I created it to showcase my portfolio, and share blog posts. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easy to maintain and update.

It is designed to be minimalistic, focusing on content rather than flashy design elements. The goal was to create a fast-loading, easy-to-navigate site that highlights my work and interests.

The repo is [here][websiterepo] and the live website is [here][websitelive].

## Features

- Minimalist design inspired by Hugo's [no-style-please] and [book] themes
- Blog section with categories and tags
- Project portfolio showcase

## Technology Stack

- [Hugo]: Static site generator, uses HTML, CSS, and Markdown under the hood
- [GitHub][github] Actions: Autonomous deployment to GitHub Pages on push to the main branch
- [GitHub Pages][githubpages]: For hosting the website

## Things to Improve

This site will continue to evolve as I learn more about web development and Hugo. Here are some areas I plan to improve:

- Add more blog posts and project entries
- Improve accessibility features
- Implement a search feature for the blog, and be able to sort by tags
- Become more mobile-friendly
